>>> TITLE: {get_title(E_PARTY)}

It's the birthday of one of the crewmembers, and the rest of the team wanted to throw a small party to celebrate.

    + [Agree / FOOD-- MORALE++]
    ~process_outcome(E_PARTY, POSITIVE)
    The party was a success. Maybe even a little too much.
    
    + [Deny / MORALE--]
    ~process_outcome(E_PARTY, NEGATIVE)
    Needless to say, your decision is not very popular among the crew.

>>> TITLE: {get_title(E_FOOD_SUPPLIES)}

We found out that on {planet_name()} there are food supplies leftover by a previous crew. They could turn out quite useful!

    + [Accept / FUEL-- FOOD++]
    ~process_outcome(E_FOOD_SUPPLIES, POSITIVE)
    Reaching the planet proved to be more difficult than anticipated, but at least we managed to collect some useful food supplies.
        
    + [Refuse / MORALE--]
    ~process_outcome(E_FOOD_SUPPLIES, NEGATIVE)
    The crew keeps on meticolously managing their rations

While going back to your quarters for the night, you can hear your crew being loud in the mess hall.

= approach
As you approach them, you realize they're playing ROLLIES, a popular dice game.<br>They ask you if you wish to join the fun, "or are you afraid to lose?", they tease.

    + [Accept / MORALE++]
    ~ process_outcome(E_ROLLIES, POSITIVE)
    
    You sit in front of one of your crewmembers, grabbing a 20-sided dice and starting to making it roll in your hand.

            You rolled a {you}, while your crewmember rolled a {them}. {you == them:It's a tie!|You {you >= them:won|lost}.}
            
            You are asked whether you want to play again.

            + + + [Enough for today]
            You excuse yourself from the rest of the crew as they keep on playing and go to sleep, knowing that bonding with your crewmembers was, indeed, a great thing to do.

    As you wait you get hit by a massive rock that wreaks havoc in the engine's room
